## Dev Tools and Frameworks

- python 3.5.2
- pip 9.0.1
- npm 3.10.10
- vue 2.9.2
- django 2.0.1
- django-rest-framework 3.7.7

## Quick Start

After installing all the tools required above, we can start the server by :

```bash
../COLOSSEUM$ python3 manage.py runserver 
```

By default, the runserver command starts the development server on the internal ip at port 8000. You can access it at

```bash
http://localhost:8000/
```

For the front end (in the development stage), we can also start by using the command

```bash
../COLOSSEUM/frontend$ npm run dev
```

this would start the server on the interal ip at port 8080, i.e:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

Enjoy~
